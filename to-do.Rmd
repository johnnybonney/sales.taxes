From meeting with Lance
1) Make price indices
    Price index is sum of quantity (in base year) multiplied by year-over-year
    change in price (e.g. quantity in 2006 * (p2008 - p2007))


First:
Weighted and unweighted:
  FOr calendar time, subtract log of Jan 2008 value from log of other value
  FOr event study plot, do the same but with t = -1 as the anchor
  
  Use Sales (m, s, Jan 2008) as a weight for the price 

Second:
  Make price indices (Lance will do this)
